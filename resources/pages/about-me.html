                                    My name is Julius and I have been writing code for about 2 years now. 
                                    For most of my life I have lived in Kampala but I also have strong connections to Rwanda due to having family there. 
                                    My development journey started out with Python but I soon found my way to web development. 
                                    I think a beautiful UI/UX is essential for a good program. Therefore I also enjoy this part of making a website. 
                                    Other than learning computer-related things, I like to go for long walks and read in my free time.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div>
                                <h3 class="sub">What are my ambitions?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    My ambition is always to get a deep understanding of whatever I do. 
                                    Right now that is web development, but really, every aspect of 
                                    developing and computer science excites me.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In the future I want to work on projects 
                                    that have a use case in the real world: 
                                    A technical solution that makes life better.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="about-text">

                                <h3 class="sub">How do I learn to code?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I learn by reading docs/blogs and by watching videos. 
                                    The latter really helped me and is still very useful when I want to learn a new topic. 
                                    Seeing how another person does something and copying it, 
                                    helps me get an understanding for programming languages, frameworks and libraries. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When I get more advanced in a certain area I switch over to docs. 
                                    I have found that most advanced knowledge is transmitted in blog articles or documentation.  
                                    From there on I start using what I just learnt in a project. 
                                    Then I learn whenever I need to figure out how to do something. 
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h3 class="sub">Why do I code?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I like doing things where I end up with a useful product.
                                    When a good friend taught me a little about coding, I soon knew: 
                                    This is what I want to do. On the one hand, this field is extremely 
                                    diverse and can be combined with other natural sciences.  
                                    Since I started with coding the reasons why I do it has never changed.
                                    It just feels so good to code, finally fix that bug, 
                                    learn a lot, and to have a nice product in the end.
                                </p>
